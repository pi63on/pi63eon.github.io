        na cviku som sa eingebracht a shared take na jeden imo graphical treatment of matrix manipulation. Potom som nerozumeli ako determinovat Clebsch-Gordon coefficient, which seemed like a confusing task some classmates took time to understand. I asked multiple queries and at last asked a classmate to explain one part which he super helpfully stopped over to explain. I still didn't get it (lol) so I asked again in the plenum whether he could maybe illustrate this on an example. At this point I might have been the only person not understanding it/being interested in hearing it, but everyone got really passionate about sharing their POVs and approaches! Multiple people even tried explaining it to me at the same time and it got pretty hectic. One classmate who I never talked to came over and then got very upset at a suggestion of my other classmate to use a certain engine to look it up! :D After that they explained again and asked me if I get it now. I must say I felt very cared for and supported in that moment!

            funny when sometimes artificial things remind me how amazing nature is.

            s holou riťou
            lebo nás je iba 5,6 miliónov
            a desatiny delíme čiarkami
            gramatiku máme tiež celkom ťažkú 
            aké máme prospekty
